## Abstract

Overlook was the final project for turing mod 2. It is a hotel website where users can see rooms the have booked, and book future rooms. Major accomplishments include:
* Utilize Webpack and fetch requests to convert the project to a server styled data structure.
* Implement SASS to clean up stylings, add mobile responsiveness.
* Implement classes with solid tests
Overall this project was a great learning experience. I was able to take time to plan out, apply what I know all under a stressful deadline.

## Technologies Used:

* CSS
* SASS
